## Welcome to Walkthrough Guide!

Here is the guide where you will be going to know what are the different tool widgets that you are going to use. I hope this guide will be enough to use the toolkit and use it.  

## Steps


![Step a](/threeJs/docs/assets/a.jpg)



a. In this above image these is the main widget in toolkit. By clicking on this button user can upload any stl model in the toolkit to proceed further. We will provide some stl models where user can choose which model to upload and then can expermient with the other widget sin the toolkit.

b. In this image you are goin to see Spray-On haptics toolkit widgets. Under **Brush** we have size for adjusting the size of paint brush. **Type** we have two types of spray paints. **Export texture model** for exporting the model in image format. **Toolkit Walkthrough Guide** will show you the roadmap of how to use this toolkit.

![Step c](/threeJs/docs/assets/c.jpg)

c. In this **Size** helps in adjusting the size of paint brush. A value of 1 is like a pencil and a value of 15 or more is like a spray paint can.

![Step f](/threeJs/docs/assets/f.jpg)



d. **Type** we have two types of spray paints. **Granite** and **Black Matt** paint.


![Step e](/threeJs/docs/assets/e.jpg)



e. **Export texture model** for exporting the model in image format(.png) and the .stl model also.


![Step h](/threeJs/docs/assets/h.jpg)


f. **Toolkit Walkthrough Guide** will show you the roadmap of how to use this toolkit.



![Step i](/threeJs/docs/assets/i.jpg)


g. **Close Controls** is for closing all widgets.



<!--Here is the code ofsome basic examples that I created for learning Javascript. JavaScript, are called “dynamically typed”, meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.]

### Day 1

[Things that I learned today:1. **Relative path:** A relative path needs to be combined with another path in order to access a file. For example, joe/foo is a relative path. Without more information, a program cannot reliably locate the joe/foo directory in the file system. 2. **Absolute path:** An absolute path always contains the root element and the complete directory list required to locate the file. For example, `/home/sally/statusReport` is an absolute path. All of the information needed to locate the file is contained in the path string. For more details see [What is a path?](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/path.html). ]
