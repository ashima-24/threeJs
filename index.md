## Welcome!

Here is the code of my first scene that I created today using threeJs library

### Day 1

Things that I learned today:

1. **Relative path:** A relative path needs to be combined with another path in order to access a file. For example, joe/foo is a relative path. Without more information, a program cannot reliably locate the joe/foo directory in the file system.

2. **Absolute path:** An absolute path always contains the root element and the complete directory list required to locate the file. For example, /home/sally/statusReport is an absolute path. All of the information needed to locate the file is contained in the path string.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ashima-24/threeJs/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
