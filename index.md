## Welcome to Walkthrough Guide!

Here is the guide where you will be going to know what are the different tool widgets that you are going to use. I hope this guide will be enough to use the toolkit and use it.

Here is the code ofsome basic examples that I created for learning Javascript. JavaScript, are called “dynamically typed”, meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.]

### Day 1

[Things that I learned today:1. **Relative path:** A relative path needs to be combined with another path in order to access a file. For example, joe/foo is a relative path. Without more information, a program cannot reliably locate the joe/foo directory in the file system. 2. **Absolute path:** An absolute path always contains the root element and the complete directory list required to locate the file. For example, `/home/sally/statusReport` is an absolute path. All of the information needed to locate the file is contained in the path string. For more details see [What is a path?](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/path.html). ]
